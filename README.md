# MacWeb 2.0c+
The base MacWeb 2.0 browser (1996) with the following changes/additions applied to enhance compatibility with black and white Macs like the Macintosh Plus:
- applied Antoine Hébert's unofficial 2.0c patch (1998) that fixes a "blackout" bug that occurs when pages have a background color set
- used ResEdit to clean up user interface elements for better rendering on 1-bit black and white displays
- packaged in .HDA format for compatibility with harddrive emulators like [BlueSCSI](https://bluescsi.com/) and software emulators like [Infinite Mac](https://infinitemac.org/1996/System%207.5.3)
- alternatively packaged as a .SIT archive (created with StuffIt Deluxe™ 5.5) if that's more your speed
- included a modified version of the GIFWatcher Desk Accessory (created using Desk Accessory Piggyback) that runs as a standard application. Set it as the "helper" application for .GIF files, and GIFWatcher will open them automatically when you request them. Thanks to Chris Adams of the Mac SE Support Pages ([archived here](https://ia800100.us.archive.org/0/items/macweb-evolt_browsers/macweb.htm)) for this workaround:

> With MacWeb 2.0, "helper" settings are controlled through Internet Config. Under MacWeb's Edit menu select Preferences and scroll down the list on the left to "File map". Click on it, then on the words "File Mappings". Internet Config launches and displays a list of file suffixes and their related file types and helper applications. Scroll down the list till you see the file extension ".gif" and select it. Click on "Change". Make sure the "Post Process" box is checked, then click on the large button directly to the right, which will show the name of some default image-viewing program, probably JPEGView. A file-selector dialogue appears, so find GIFwatcher and open it. Now click on "OK", then close the "File Mappings" window. From the menu bar choose "File" and "Save", then quit Internet Config.
> 
> The next time you click on a web page GIF image icon in MacWeb 2.0, GIFwatcher will launch automatically and display it. 

Happy Browsing!
